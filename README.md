## Recommendation systems
Content and Collaborative filtering for User-Movie recommendation system. 

Content filtering: 

*   Implemented K means clustering algorithm to cluster the movies based on contents (genres of the movies). Predicted rating for a particular movie based on the ratings that user give to other movies grouped in the same cluster.


Collaborative filtering:

*   Looks for user-user similarity. Implemented neural network in sense of matrix factorization. No information about content of the movies has been used.
